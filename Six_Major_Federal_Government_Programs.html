				<h1>The Six Major U.S. Welfare Programs</h1>

<h2>Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program (TANF)</h2>
<p>The TANF program assists families with children when parents or other responsible relatives
cannot provide for the family's basic needs for a period of time. The Federal government provides
grants to States to run the TANF program. TANF provided income to 2.5 million recipients in
2017. Of these, 1.9 million were children. In 2016, TANF assisted only 23 percent of the families
living in poverty. On average, a three-person family received $447 a month. Despite this help, they
still maintain a status below the poverty line. The new requirements were the reason for this
decrease in coverage. Families who receive TANF must get a job within two years.</p>
<p>Over time, TANF has provided basic cash assistance to fewer and fewer needy families, even when
need has increased. The amount of cash assistance provided to families has eroded in almost every
state. This leaves families without sufficient funds to meet their most basic needs. Although a key
focus of welfare reform was on increasing employment among cash assistance recipients, states
spend little of their TANF funds on helping improve the employability of a TANF recipient.</p>
<p>Employment among single mothers increased in the 1990s, but welfare reform was only one of
several contributing factors. Additionally, most of these early gains have been lost. The TANF
block grant was inequitable from its genesis and has only grown increasingly inequitable over the
last two decades. TANF plays much less of a role in reducing poverty than AFDC did, and the
provision of less cash assistance has contributed to an increase in deep or extreme poverty.</p>

<h2>Medicaid</h2>
<p>Medicaid paid for the health care of 75.1 million low-income adults in 2017. The largest share, of
this cost (40 percent) went to 30.0 million children. In 2014, Medicaid also paid health expenses
for 9.8 million blind and disabled people. The smallest category of beneficiary was 5.4 million
low-income seniors. Medicaid pays for any health costs that Medicare does not cover. The
Affordable Care Act increased Medicaid coverage by 28 percent. The act also raised the
qualification income level and allowed single adults to qualify.</p>

<h2>Child's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)</h2>
<p>In addition to Medicaid, 6 million children received additional benefits from CHIP. CHIP covers
hospital care, medical supplies, and tests. It also provides preventive care, such as eye exams,
dental care, and regular check-ups to children.</p>

<h2>Food Stamps - Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)</h2>
<p>Food Stamps are part of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It provided food
vouchers to 42.6 million people in 2017. The average individual received $126 a month. The total
federal cost for SNAP in fiscal year 2017 was over $70 billion. 93 percent of this was spent on
food and the rest was spent on administrative costs. It requires recipients without children to work
after three months. The program waives the requirement for those who live in areas with high
unemployment rates.</p>
<p>There's an additional food stamp program for nursing mothers and young children. The Special
Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provides food or vouchers,
education, and referrals to help feed pregnant women and children up to age six. In 2017, 7.3
million people received WIC each month. Of those, more than 75 percent were children or infants.
The Child Nutrition Program provides free or reduced-cost lunches to 30 million children. It costs
the federal government $12 billion.</p>

<h2>Supplemental Security Program</h2>
<p>The Supplemental Security Program provides cash to help the aged, blind, and disabled pay for
food, clothing, and shelter. As of 2018, roughly 8.2 million people receive an average $551 per
month. Of those, 7.3 million are blind or disabled.</p>

<h2>Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)</h2>
<p>The Earned Income Tax Credit is a tax credit for families with at least one child. It is a benefit for
working people with low to moderate income. To qualify, you must meet certain requirements and
file a tax return. A tax return must be filed even if you do not owe any tax or are not required to
file. EITC reduces the amount of tax you owe and may give you a refund. To qualify for EITC you
must also meet some basic requirements and have earned income from working for someone or
from running or owning a business or farm. Additionally, you must have a child that meets all the
qualifying rules for your income or meet an additional criterion pertaining to workers without a
qualifying child.</p>
<p>For tax year 2018, a family of four (married filing jointly) must earn less than $51,492 a year to
qualify. In tax year 2017, over 27 million received credits totaling $65 billion for an average $2,455
per taxpayer. EITC lifted approximately 9.4 million people out of poverty, half of whom were
children. It costs just 1 percent of the amount paid out to administer it. Unfortunately, almost onefourth
of the payments are in error.</p>

<h2>Housing Assistance</h2>
<p>Housing Assistance is provided through 1.2 million units of public housing. The Housing Choice
Voucher Program gives certificates to rent approved units. The subsidy allows those who qualify
to pay no more than 30 percent of their income in rent. Local agencies administer housing
assistance to 2.2 million renters. This was formerly known as the Section 8 program. The Public
Housing Agency allows some families to use the voucher to purchase a modest home.</p>
<p>The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program provides energy assistance and
weatherization programs. In 2018, it provided $3.64 billion in block grants to the states.</p>

<h2>Major takeaway from the web search:</h2>
<p>With a number of states planning ways to tighten their Medicaid and food stamp rolls, Americans
continue to believe that too many counts on the government for cash and that government welfare
programs hurt more than they help.</p>
<p>A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that 61% of American
Adults think there are too many Americans dependent on the government for financial aid. Thatâ€™s
up from 55% in March of last year (2017) after running in the mid- to high-60s over the previous
four years. Just nine percent (9%) think there are not enough Americans dependent on the
government for financial aid, while 18% think the level of dependency is about right. Twelve
percent (12%) are not sure.</p>
